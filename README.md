# Boilerplates

This repository is my personal collection of templates that I use to set up my development environment. It includes configurations for various tools and frameworks that I frequently use.

If you find any of these configurations useful, feel free to use them as a reference or adapt them for your own setup. And if you're searching for detailed explanations of each configuration, you're in the right place but checkout my [site](https://mlorente.dev).
